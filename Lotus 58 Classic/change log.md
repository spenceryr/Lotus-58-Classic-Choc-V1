Change Log Lotus 58 TRRS/Classic

- v1.00 - Initial release
   - This verison unfortunately had various RGB issues. Used through hole mounted SK6812 mini RGB's for both per-key and glow.
- v1.11 - Intermediary release
  - RGB issues fixed, improved silkscreen for easier building.
- v1.23 - Second release
  - Greatly improved design, per-key moved to SK6812 mini-e winged RGB, and glow remains as surface mounted SK6812 mini.
  - Added support for battery connector and power switch for wireless builds.
- v1.24 - Intermediary release
   - Added Silkscreen build instructions
  - Added TRRS ESD protection
  - Removed i2c resistors
  - Repositioned reset for easier access
  - Minor cleanup of routing and silkscreen
- v1.26 - Third Release
  - Brings TRRS variant to feature parity with USB C variant by moving ALL RGB to SK6812 mini-e.
  - All RGB can be soldered, and either glow or key can be selected to be active (drawing power)
  - Switch positions are the same as USB-C so reset and power switch can now be on both sides of PCB (easier 3D printing)
  - Better footprints, so easier to solder.
  - Since the TRRS version already have a power switch, the RGB is an internal switch, placed where you need to disassemble, alternatively hard soldered jumpers.
- v1.27 - Intermediary release
  - Improved Silkscreen/build instructions on PCB
- v1.28 - Fourth release
  - Possible to select the function of the external slide switch, setting it as a power switch for wireless builds, or to select RGB for a wired build
