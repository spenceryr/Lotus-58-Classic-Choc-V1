# Lotus 58 Glow

Starting with simple tweaks to the Lily58 Glow before ordering a set of PCB's it quickly spiraled out of control, and I ended up with what wasn't quite a Lily58 anymore, and although very similar in layout, it is no longer compatible with plate and case design. 

Because of this, it was renamed Lotus58, referencing another flower much like the lily in the name Lily58.

## General Specifications

- Layout very similar to the original Lily58 family
- Per key RGB and RGB underglow
- Kaihl Hot-swap sockets for MX compatible switches
- Can be used as a standalone Gamepad for either hand
- Optional 0.91" OLED Screens and rotary encoders (one each per side)
- All components through-hole and easily soldered for beginners (SMD option for diodes)
- Designed with a sandwich-style plate/case as part of the design


## Layout variations

- Optional plate layout with OLED screen (Encoder can be placed on upper thumb key position)
- Optional plate layout with rotary encoder (Removes OLED screen for that side)  
- Optional plate layout with no hole for OLED or upper encoder (Encoder can be placed on upper thumb key position)

## Things to note when ordering PCB's
### Finding the Gerber files
If you are not aiming at modifying things, don't look for the gerber files in the folders, pretty please!</BR>
And please don't open yet another issue about it! </BR>
The gerber files are where they belong, zipped up in releases, look under that header for the version you want.

### Tips & Tricks
- Most PCB manufacturers have a MOQ of 5 PCB's, meaning you end up with 2½ keyboards when finished.
- The recommended PCB thickness is 1.6 mm, both for the main PCB and plates to allow the keyswitches to grip the plate and lock in place securely.

If ordering from [JLPCB](https://www.jlpcb.com) the plate Gerber files include a reference putting the added serial etc on a breakaway part for a clean look with minimal cost, if using another manufacturer it's possible they have additional fee's for removing the extra text, or you should consider plotting the Gerber files yourself with the correct reference for your manufacturer. Otherwise use the standard settings from JLPCB.

# Buy a kit!
I sell complete kits, making it easy to build your keyboard, and it also supports prototypes for new wacky ones.
